How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By comparing the different versions of a file, we know how changes were 
made, and by looking at the changes, we know why the bug is made.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   Because I do not need to save and go back to the previous versions manually

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    automatically saving the versions can avoid the risk such as the versions are 
not committed. Manually saving the versions has the advantage of XXX. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because the files are internally linked. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log ==> to see all commits
    git diff id1 id2 ==> see the differences between two ids

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    git checkout ==> able to go back to previous version and check which version introduced the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
